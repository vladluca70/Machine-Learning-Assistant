# 🤖 Machine Learning Assistant - Educational Web Application

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Assistant** repository — my final year bachelor’s thesis project for the Computer Science faculty! 🎓✨

This project is a **web-based educational platform** designed to help students and anyone interested in learning about Machine Learning (ML) in an interactive and accessible way.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Machine Learning Assistant** is a website that introduces fundamental ML concepts, explains key algorithms both theoretically and practically, and provides users with an engaging learning experience by combining technical knowledge with creative insights.

The application is built using:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (with animations, gradients, and responsive design)
- **Backend:** Python with Flask framework
- **Template Engine:** Jinja2
- **Libraries:** `math`, `matplotlib`, `base64`, `io`, and others for data processing and visualization

The project is structured following Flask’s best practices: static files (CSS, images) are in the `static` folder, and HTML templates are in the `templates` folder. Python decorators link backend functions to URLs for smooth routing and handling.

## 🏠 Home Page

- **Definition of Machine Learning:** A clear and concise introduction to ML concepts.
- **Learning Outcomes:** What users will understand after exploring the site.
- **Presented Algorithms:** Overview of the ML algorithms covered.
- **Useful Links:** Curated resources for deeper exploration.

---

## 🔍 Algorithms Covered

Each algorithm has two dedicated pages:

### 1. Theoretical Concepts  
- Detailed explanation of how the algorithm works step-by-step to perform classification or prediction.
- A **unique innovation:** each algorithm’s process is associated with 2-3 **biblical verses** that resonate with its essence, followed by my personal interpretation linking spirituality and technology.
- A glossary section with **key terms and their definitions** to ensure clear understanding of frequently used concepts.

### 2. Practical Example  
- Interactive input form where users can submit their own small datasets (small size is encouraged for easier comprehension).
- Backend processing of data including:
  - Storing user input in variables and lists.
  - Applying the ML algorithm.
  - Generating visualizations with `matplotlib` for better data comprehension.
- Compressed images and processed data are sent back to the frontend and displayed elegantly using Jinja2 templating.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- **Flask decorators** to associate Python functions with URLs.
- Clear separation of concerns with **HTML templates**, **static assets**, and backend logic.
- **Responsive design** with smooth animations and appealing gradients for a modern user experience.
- Theme switching feature — users can choose from multiple visual themes to personalize their learning environment.

## 💡 Why This Project is Unique

Compared to other ML educational applications, **Machine Learning Assistant** offers a fresh approach by:

- Combining **theoretical knowledge** with **practical coding exercises**.
- Adding an **innovative spiritual dimension** by associating algorithm logic with meaningful biblical verses and interpretations.
- Providing **interactive visualizations** to enhance intuitive understanding.
- Maintaining a clean, user-friendly interface that adapts to all devices.
